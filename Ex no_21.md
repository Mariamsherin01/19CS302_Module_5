# EX 21 C program to calculate the area of a triangle using pointer.
## AIM:
To write a C program to calculate the area of a triangle using pointer.

## Algorithm
1. Declare float variables radius and area, and pointers to them.
2. Read the radius value using the radius pointer.
3. Calculate area using the formula area = Ï€ * radius * radius via pointers.
4. Print the calculated area using the area pointer.


## Program:
```

}
*/
```

## Output:
